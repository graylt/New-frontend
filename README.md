# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Cautious Ape - Frontend

## App Production & Deployment Timeline - June 6th, 2022

## Collaborators: Tricia Gray & Jacqueline Schmidt

### App Background:

Programmed and deployed a full-stack application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) NFT’s from their watchlist.

We leveraged a 3rd party API to bring in ETH and SOL prices - the main crypto currencies in which NFT’s are bought and sold. We also implemented a crypto calculator for users to convert prices in USD to either ETH or SOL depending on the users’ choice.

## Tech:

This app was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and deployed using MongoDB Atlas and Heroku.

`MongoDB` - document database

`Express(.js)` - Node.js web framework

`React(.js)` - a client-side JavaScript framework

`Node(.js)` - JavaScript web server

## Improvements for the future:

Implement search functionality for users to efficiently find and locate NFT’s from their watchlist

Implement user authentication - I.e. login credentials

## What went well

Implemented GitHub best practices when collaborating on projects - I.e., created branches specific to features and/or certain functionality. Tested each before merging to dev/ main branches and eventually deploying.

Utilized Miro - project management tool to help prioritize daily sprint goals in order to complete MVP (minimum viable product). Once we were able to successfully finish MVP we used Miro to help us visualize stretch goals and our app design.
